Overview
WeatherWise is a client-side web application designed to provide users with current weather conditions and a multi-day forecast for a specified location. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project leverages a public weather API to fetch and display real-time weather data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.

Features
Current Weather Display: Shows key metrics like temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and a weather description (e.g., "Clear Sky," "Partly Cloudy").

Location-Based Search: Users can input a city name to retrieve weather information for that specific location.

Multi-Day Forecast: Provides a forecast for the upcoming 3-5 days, including high/low temperatures and weather icons.

Dynamic Backgrounds: Changes the background image or color scheme based on the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Error Handling: Provides user-friendly messages for invalid city inputs or API errors.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Structures the content and layout of the web application.

CSS3: Styles the application, providing a modern and clean user interface.

JavaScript (ES6+): Handles all the dynamic functionality, including API calls, data parsing, and DOM manipulation.

[Weather API Name] (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API): The primary data source for weather information. (Important: You will need to replace [Weather API Name] with the actual API you used, and provide instructions on how to obtain an API key if necessary.)

How to Use
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weatherwise.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Bash

cd weatherwise
Obtain an API Key:

Go to [Weather API Provider Website URL] (e.g., https://openweathermap.org/api).

Sign up for a free account and obtain your API key.

(Optional but Recommended:) Create a file named config.js (or similar) in your project's root directory and store your API key there:

JavaScript

// config.js
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
Then, make sure to import this file into your main JavaScript file. Never commit your API key directly into your main JavaScript file or a public repository.

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. No local server is required as it's a client-side application.

API Integration
This project relies on the [Weather API Name] for fetching weather data. The JavaScript code makes asynchronous requests to the API endpoints and processes the JSON responses to extract relevant weather information.

Current Weather Endpoint: [Example: api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}]

Forecast Endpoint: [Example: api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name}&appid={API key}]

Customization
Styling: Modify css/style.css to change colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness.

API Integration: If you wish to use a different weather API, you'll need to update the API endpoints and data parsing logic in js/script.js accordingly.

Features: Extend the functionality by adding more weather metrics, interactive charts, or saved locations.
